## Course Note - Day 3: Combinational Logic Design

In this session, we will dive deeper into combinational logic design, building upon the concepts covered in the previous session. Here's an overview of the topics we will explore:

### 1. Combinational Circuits

We will discuss the behavior and design principles of combinational circuits, which consist of interconnected logic gates. Understanding how inputs propagate through the circuit to produce the desired outputs will be our primary focus.

### 2. Boolean Expressions and Truth Tables

We will review how Boolean expressions and truth tables are used to represent the logic of combinational circuits. Analyzing and manipulating these expressions will allow us to simplify and optimize the design.

### 3. Karnaugh Maps

We will introduce Karnaugh maps as a graphical method for simplifying Boolean expressions and reducing the number of gates required in a circuit. Learning to identify patterns and groups within Karnaugh maps will help in minimizing the logic equations.

### 4. Multiplexers and Demultiplexers

We will explore the functionality and applications of multiplexers and demultiplexers in combinational logic design. Understanding how these components select and route data will be essential for more complex circuit designs.

### 5. Encoders and Decoders

We will study encoders and decoders, which are used to convert between different data formats in digital systems. Examining their structure and working principles will provide insights into designing efficient data encoding and decoding circuits.

By the end of this session, you will have a solid understanding of combinational logic design principles and techniques. This knowledge will be crucial as we move forward to more advanced topics such as sequential logic design.

**Note:** This is a condensed course note for Day 3. The full course material will provide more detailed explanations, examples, and exercises to reinforce your understanding of combinational logic design.

## Course Note - Day 4: Introduction to Verilog

In this session, we will focus on Verilog, the hardware description language (HDL) commonly used in digital circuit design. Here's what we will cover:

### 1. Introduction to Verilog

We will discuss the purpose and benefits of using Verilog in the design and verification of digital systems. Understanding the role of Verilog in RTL design and simulation will be emphasized.

### 2. Verilog Basics

We will explore the syntax, structure, and basic constructs of Verilog. Learning how to define modules, signals, data types, and operators will enable us to describe digital circuits in Verilog.

### 3. RTL Modeling in Verilog

We will focus on Register Transfer Level (RTL) modeling using Verilog, which allows us to capture the behavior and structure of digital systems. Understanding how to describe combinational and sequential logic using Verilog will be a key objective.

### 4. Testbench Development in Verilog

We will cover the basics of testbench development in Verilog, which involves creating stimulus and verifying the functionality of RTL designs. Learning how to write testbenches to simulate and validate digital circuits will be an essential skill.

### 5. Simulation and Verification in Verilog

We will explore how to simulate and verify digital designs using Verilog testbenches. Understanding the simulation process and analyzing the simulation results will be crucial for detecting and fixing design issues.

By the end of this session, you will have a solid foundation in Verilog, allowing you to describe and simulate digital circuits effectively. This knowledge will serve as a stepping stone for advanced RTL design and verification techniques.

**Note:** This is a condensed course note for Day 4. The full course material will provide more comprehensive coverage of Verilog, including advanced constructs and practical examples for hands-on practice.
