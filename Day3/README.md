**Course Note - Day 3: Combinational Logic Design**

In this session, we will dive deeper into combinational logic design, building upon the concepts covered in the previous session. Here's an overview of the topics we will explore:

Combinational Circuits:

We will discuss the behavior and design principles of combinational circuits, which consist of interconnected logic gates.
Understanding how inputs propagate through the circuit to produce the desired outputs will be our primary focus.
Boolean Expressions and Truth Tables:

We will review how Boolean expressions and truth tables are used to represent the logic of combinational circuits.
Analyzing and manipulating these expressions will allow us to simplify and optimize the design.
Karnaugh Maps:

We will introduce Karnaugh maps as a graphical method for simplifying Boolean expressions and reducing the number of gates required in a circuit.
Learning to identify patterns and groups within Karnaugh maps will help in minimizing the logic equations.
Multiplexers and Demultiplexers:

We will explore the functionality and applications of multiplexers and demultiplexers in combinational logic design.
Understanding how these components select and route data will be essential for more complex circuit designs.
Encoders and Decoders:

We will study encoders and decoders, which are used to convert between different data formats in digital systems.
Examining their structure and working principles will provide insights into designing efficient data encoding and decoding circuits.
By the end of this session, you will have a solid understanding of combinational logic design principles and techniques. This knowledge will be crucial as we move forward to more advanced topics such as sequential logic design.

Note: This is a condensed course note for Day 3. The full course material will provide more detailed explanations, examples, and exercises to reinforce your understanding of combinational logic design.
