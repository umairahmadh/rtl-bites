**Course Note - Day 2: Introduction to Digital Logic**

In this session, we will cover the fundamental concepts of digital logic, which are essential for understanding RTL design. Here's an overview of the topics we will explore:

1. Boolean Algebra:
   - We will review the basic laws and operations of Boolean algebra, which forms the foundation of digital logic.
   - Understanding Boolean algebra will enable us to manipulate and simplify logical expressions effectively.

2. Logic Gates:
   - We will study different types of logic gates, including AND, OR, NOT, and XOR gates.
   - Exploring their truth tables and logical behavior will help us comprehend their functionality within digital circuits.

3. Combinational Logic Design:
   - We will dive into the design of combinational logic circuits using logic gates.
   - Understanding how to express combinational logic using Boolean expressions and truth tables will be a key focus.

4. Introduction to Digital Components:
   - We will explore essential digital components such as multiplexers, decoders, and encoders.
   - Understanding their functionality and applications will broaden our understanding of digital circuit design.

5. Asynchronous and Synchronous Logic:
   - We will differentiate between asynchronous and synchronous logic design approaches.
   - Introducing the concept of clocked elements, we will explore their significance in synchronous designs.

By the end of this session, you will have a solid understanding of digital logic principles and their role in RTL design. This knowledge will serve as a strong foundation for the topics we will cover in the upcoming sessions, such as combinational and sequential logic design.

Note: This is a summary course note for Day 2. The full course material will provide more comprehensive explanations and may include hands-on exercises for practical application.
