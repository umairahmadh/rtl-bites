## Course Note - Day 5: Combinational Circuits - Multiplexers, Decoders, and Encoders

In this session, we will continue our exploration of combinational circuits by focusing on multiplexers, decoders, and encoders. Here's an overview of the topics we will cover:

### 1. Multiplexers (MUX)

- We will dive into the functionality and applications of multiplexers.
- Understanding how multiplexers select and route data based on control signals will be our main focus.
- We will learn how to design multiplexers using logic gates or truth tables.

### 2. Decoders

- We will study the purpose and operation of decoders in digital circuits.
- Understanding how decoders convert encoded data into a set of output signals will be emphasized.
- We will explore different types of decoders, such as binary decoders and BCD decoders.

### 3. Encoders

- We will explore the role of encoders in digital systems.
- Understanding how encoders convert multiple input signals into a smaller set of output signals will be our primary objective.
- We will discuss various encoder designs, including priority encoders and rotary encoders.

### 4. Applications and Circuit Design

- We will examine practical applications of multiplexers, decoders, and encoders in digital systems.
- Learning how to integrate these components into larger combinational circuits will be emphasized.
- We will discuss the importance of circuit optimization and ways to minimize the number of gates and delay.

By the end of this session, you will have a solid understanding of multiplexers, decoders, and encoders, as well as their applications in combinational circuit design. This knowledge will be valuable as we continue exploring more complex digital logic components and circuitry.

**Note:** This is a condensed course note for Day 5. The full course material will provide more detailed explanations, examples, and exercises to reinforce your understanding of multiplexers, decoders, and encoders.
